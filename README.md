# Console-Finances

## Description

### In this project I used .js to analyse a dataset and provide the following information:

The total months in the dataset

The net total profit/loss made over the total months

The mean average of the difference between all consecutive months

The greatest Increase and Decrease between 2 consecutive months

### The benefits from these additions to the dataset are:

Easier to understand general statistics about the dataset without having to parse through it
